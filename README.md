# üîÅ CCNA Switching Practicals ‚Äì Inter-VLAN Routing & Layer 3 Configurations

This repository showcases **VLAN segmentation**, **Inter-VLAN communication**, and **switching techniques**‚Äîkey skills for real-world enterprise networking.

---

## üìå Objective

To practically understand and configure VLANs, Inter-VLAN routing using both routers and Layer 3 switches, implement dynamic IP assignment via DHCP, and secure switch ports with port security measures.
